  title: NxtPort T-mining Secure Container Release API Record delivery
  description: When the driver has delivered the container, a request should be sent
    to the server to record (create) the delivery. Note that a delivery is associated
    with a PickupRight, because the driver who gets a PickupRight, will automatically
    get a right to deliver the container. For that reason, the PickupRight must be
    reported.
